                <p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel cloud-edge framework for addressing computational
                    and energy constraints in complex control systems. Our approach centers around
                    a learning-based controller using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) on physical
                    plants. By integrating a biologically plausible learning method with local
                    plasticity rules, we harness the efficiency, scalability, and low latency of
                    SNNs. This design replicates control signals from a cloud-based controller
                    directly on the plant, reducing the need for constant plant-cloud
                    communication. The plant updates weights only when errors surpass predefined
                    thresholds, ensuring efficiency and robustness in various conditions. Applied
                    to linear workbench systems and satellite rendezvous scenarios, including
                    obstacle avoidance, our architecture dramatically lowers normalized tracking
                    error by 96% with increased network size. The event-driven nature of SNNs
                    minimizes energy consumption, utilizing only about 111 nJ (0.3% of conventional
                    computing requirements). The results demonstrate the system's adjustment to
                    changing work environments and its efficient use of computational and energy
                    resources, with a moderate increase in energy consumption of 27.2% and 37% for
                    static and dynamic obstacles, respectively, compared to non-obstacle scenarios.

                <p class="mathjax">This report proposes a robust method for classifying oceanic and atmospheric
                    phenomena using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Our proposed method
                    leverages the powerful pre-trained model Swin Transformer v2 Large as the
                    backbone and employs carefully designed data augmentation and exponential
                    moving average during training to enhance the model's generalization capability
                    and stability. In the testing stage, a method called ReAct is utilized to
                    rectify activation values and utilize Energy Score for more accurate
                    measurement of model uncertainty, significantly improving out-of-distribution
                    detection performance. Furthermore, test time augmentation is employed to
                    enhance classification accuracy and prediction stability. Comprehensive
                    experimental results demonstrate that each additional technique significantly
                    improves classification accuracy, confirming their effectiveness in classifying
                    maritime and atmospheric phenomena in SAR imagery.

                <p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a basic RGB single-mode model based on weakly
                    supervised training under pseudo labels, which performs high-precision
                    authenticity identification under multi-scene typical target remote sensing
                    images. Due to the imprecision of Mask generation, we divide the task into two
                    sub-tasks: generating pseudo-mask and fine-tuning model based on generated
                    Masks. In generating pseudo masks, we use MM-Fusion as the base model to
                    generate masks for large objects such as planes and ships. By manually
                    calibrating the Mask of a small object such as a car, a highly accurate
                    pseudo-mask is obtained. For the task of fine-tuning models based on generating
                    masks, we use the WSCL model as the base model. It is worth noting that due to
                    the difference between the generated pseudo-Masks and the real Masks, we
                    discard the image feature extractors such as SRM and Noiseprint++ in WSCL, and
                    select the unscaled original image for training alone, which greatly ensures
                    the match between the image and the original label. The final trained model
                    achieved a score of 90.7702 on the test set.

                <p class="mathjax">In this study, a novel open-source brain-computer interface (BCI) platform
                    was developed to decode scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated
                    with sustained attention. The EEG signal collection was conducted using a
                    wireless headset during a sustained visual attention task, where participants
                    were instructed to discriminate between composite images superimposed with
                    scenes and faces, responding only to the relevant subcategory while ignoring
                    the irrelevant ones. Seven volunteers participated in this experiment. The data
                    collected were subjected to analyses through event-related potential (ERP),
                    Hilbert Transform, and Wavelet Transform to extract temporal and spectral
                    features. For each participant, utilizing its extracted features, personalized
                    Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models with tuned
                    hyperparameters were developed. The models aimed to decode the participant's
                    attentional state towards the face and scene stimuli. The SVM models achieved a
                    higher average accuracy of 80\% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.86,
                    while the RF models showed an average accuracy of 78\% and AUC of 0.8. This
                    work suggests potential applications for the evaluation of visual attention and
                    the development of closed-loop brainwave regulation systems in the future.

                <p class="mathjax">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are
                    increasingly used in multimodal analysis of neurodegenerative disorders. While
                    MRI is broadly utilized in clinical settings, PET is less accessible. Many
                    studies have attempted to use deep generative models to synthesize PET from MRI
                    scans. However, they often suffer from unstable training and inadequately
                    preserve brain functional information conveyed by PET. To this end, we propose
                    a functional imaging constrained diffusion (FICD) framework for 3D brain PET
                    image synthesis with paired structural MRI as input condition, through a new
                    constrained diffusion model (CDM). The FICD introduces noise to PET and then
                    progressively removes it with CDM, ensuring high output fidelity throughout a
                    stable training phase. The CDM learns to predict denoised PET with a functional
                    imaging constraint introduced to ensure voxel-wise alignment between each
                    denoised PET and its ground truth. Quantitative and qualitative analyses
                    conducted on 293 subjects with paired T1-weighted MRI and
                    18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans suggest that FICD achieves superior
                    performance in generating FDG-PET data compared to state-of-the-art methods. We
                    further validate the effectiveness of the proposed FICD on data from a total of
                    1,262 subjects through three downstream tasks, with experimental results
                    suggesting its utility and generalizability.

                <p class="mathjax">Industrial applications of plasma have significantly increased beyond
                    semiconductor manufacturing in recent years. This necessitates training a
                    skilled workforce in plasma science and technology. However, an essential
                    challenge to this end stems from the high cost of plasma devices and
                    diagnostics. The limited access to plasma devices has hindered plasma
                    education, particularly in the least developed countries. To this end, this
                    paper demonstrates how low-cost sensors and circuits can be developed to enable
                    inexpensive plasma experiments in laboratory environments. In particular, we
                    show how to measure high voltage, current, and power from a cold-atmospheric
                    plasma discharge. Additionally, we develop a low-cost illuminance sensor and
                    demonstrate how it can be used to estimate the corresponding plasma power. The
                    low-cost sensors and electronics presented in this paper can aid educators in
                    characterizing plasma power versus plasma illuminance.

                <p class="mathjax">This paper considers an incremental Volt/Var control scheme for distribution
                    systems with high integration of inverter-interfaced distributed generation
                    (such as photovoltaic systems). The incremental Volt/Var controller is
                    implemented with the objective of minimizing reactive power usage while
                    maintaining voltages within safe limits sufficiently often. To this end, the
                    parameters of the incremental Volt/Var controller are obtained by solving a
                    chance-constrained optimization problem, where constraints are designed to
                    ensure that voltage violations do not occur more often than a pre-specified
                    probability. This approach leads to cost savings in a controlled, predictable
                    way, while still avoiding significant over- or under-voltage issues. The
                    proposed chance-constrained problem is solved using a successive convex
                    approximation method. Once the gains are broadcast to the inverters, no
                    additional communication is required since the controller is implemented
                    locally at the inverters. The proposed method is successfully tested on a
                    low-voltage 42-nodes network.

                <p class="mathjax">This paper proposes a new robust data-driven control method for linear
                    systems with bounded disturbances, where the system model and disturbances are
                    unknown. Due to disturbances, accurately determining the true system becomes
                    challenging using the collected dataset. Therefore, instead of designing
                    controllers directly for the unknown true system, an available approach is to
                    design controllers for all systems compatible with the dataset. To overcome the
                    limitations of using a single dataset and benefit from collecting more data,
                    multiple datasets are employed in this paper. Furthermore, a new iterative
                    method is developed to address the challenges of using multiple datasets. Based
                    on this method, this paper develops an offline and online robust data-driven
                    iterative control method, respectively. Compared to the existing robust
                    data-driven controller method, both proposed control methods iteratively
                    utilize multiple datasets in the controller design process. This allows for the
                    incorporation of numerous datasets, potentially reducing the conservativeness
                    of the designed controller. Particularly, the online controller is iteratively
                    designed by continuously incorporating online collected data into the
                    historical data to construct new datasets. Lastly, the effectiveness of the
                    proposed methods is demonstrated using a batch reactor.

                <p class="mathjax">Sepsis-induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a serious complication with
                    a poor prognosis. This paper presents a deep representation learningbased
                    phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of
                    septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset
                    from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients
                    admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of
                    invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in
                    southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters
                    were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete
                    Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR
                    variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the
                    K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model
                    yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver
                    dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ
                    dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to
                    compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p &lt;
                    0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our
                    deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that
                    reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality
                    outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical
                    insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.

                <p class="mathjax">Enriching geometric information on radio frequency (RF) signal power
                    distribution in wireless communication systems, the radiomap has become an
                    essential tool for resource allocation and network management. Usually, a dense
                    radiomap is reconstructed from sparse observations collected by deployed
                    sensors or mobile devices, which makes the radiomap estimation an urgent
                    challenge. To leverage both physical principles of radio propagation models and
                    data statistics from sparse observations, this work introduces a novel
                    task-incentivized generative learning model, namely TiRE-GAN, for radiomap
                    estimation. Specifically, we first introduce a radio depth map as input to
                    capture the overall pattern of radio propagation and shadowing effects,
                    following which a task-driven incentive network is proposed to provide feedback
                    for radiomap compensation depending on downstream tasks. Our experimental
                    results demonstrate the power of the radio depth map to capture radio
                    propagation information, together with the efficiency of the proposed TiRE-GAN
                    for radiomap estimation.

                    reachability of a system and the risk distribution of a scenario. We propose an
                    algorithm to approximate the reachability of a nonlinear system under stealth
                    attacks with a union of standard sets. Meanwhile, we present a method to
                    construct a risk field to formally describe the risk distribution in a given
                    scenario. The intersection relationships of system reachability and risk
                    regions in the risk field indicate that attackers can cause corresponding risks
                    without being detected. Based on this, we introduce a metric to dynamically
                    quantify the risk. Compared to traditional methods, our framework predicts the
                    risk value in an explainable way and provides early warnings for safety
                    control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study
                    of an automated warehouse.

                <p class="mathjax">This paper deals with the problem of clustering data returned by a radar
                    sensor network that monitors a region where multiple moving targets are
                    present. The network is formed by nodes with limited functionalities that
                    transmit the estimates of target positions (after a detection) to a fusion
                    center without any association between measurements and targets. To solve the
                    problem at hand, we resort to model-based learning algorithms and instead of
                    applying the plain maximum likelihood approach, due to the related
                    computational requirements, we exploit the latent variable model coupled with
                    the expectation-maximization algorithm. The devised estimation procedure
                    returns posterior probabilities that are used to cluster the huge amount of
                    data collected by the fusion center. Remarkably, we also consider challenging
                    scenarios with an unknown number of targets and estimate it by means of the
                    model order selection rules. The clustering performance of the proposed
                    strategy is compared to that of conventional data-driven methods over synthetic
                    data. The numerical examples point out that the herein proposed solutions can
                    provide reliable clustering performance overcoming the considered competitors.

                <p class="mathjax">The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when
                    the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and
                    Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization
                    condition. When the crystallization condition is satisfied, we describe how to
                    integrate sensing and communication within a single Zak-OTFS subframe by
                    transmitting a pilot in the center of the subframe and surrounding the pilot
                    with a pilot region and guard band to mitigate interference between data
                    symbols and pilot. At the receiver we first read off the effective channel taps
                    within the pilot region, and then use the estimated channel taps to recover the
                    data from the symbols received outside the pilot region. We introduce a
                    framework for filter design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where the
                    symplectic Fourier transform connects aliasing in the DD domain (predictability
                    of the I/O relation) with time/bandwidth expansion. The choice of pulse shaping
                    filter determines the fraction of pilot energy that lies outside the pilot
                    region and the degradation in BER performance that results from the
                    interference to data symbols. We demonstrate that Gaussian filters in the DD
                    domain provide significant improvements in BER performance over the sinc and
                    root raised cosine filters considered in previous work. We also demonstrate
                    that, by limiting DD domain aliasing, Gaussian filters extend the region where
                    the crystallization condition is satisfied. The Gaussian filters considered in
                    this paper are a particular case of factorizable pulse shaping filters in the
                    DD domain, and this family of filters may be of independent interest.

                <p class="mathjax">The Internet of Things paradigm heavily relies on a network of a massive
                    number of machine-type devices (MTDs) that monitor changes in various
                    phenomena. Consequently, MTDs are randomly activated at different times
                    whenever a change occurs. This essentially results in relatively few MTDs being
                    active simultaneously compared to the entire network, resembling targeted
                    sampling in compressed sensing. Therefore, signal recovery in machine-type
                    communications is addressed through joint user activity detection and channel
                    estimation algorithms built using compressed sensing theory. However, most of
                    these algorithms follow a two-stage procedure in which a channel is first
                    estimated and later mapped to find active users. This approach is inefficient
                    because the estimated channel information is subsequently discarded. To
                    overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel covariance-learning matching
                    pursuit algorithm that bypasses explicit channel estimation. Instead, it
                    focuses on estimating the indices of the active users greedily. Simulation
                    results presented in terms of probability of miss detection, exact recovery
                    rate, and computational complexity validate the proposed technique's superior
                    performance and efficiency.

                <p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) for Direction of Arrival (DOA)
                    estimation have highlighted its superiority over traditional methods, offering
                    faster inference, enhanced super-resolution, and robust performance in low
                    Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. Despite these advancements, existing
                    research predominantly focuses on multi-snapshot scenarios, a limitation in the
                    context of automotive radar systems which demand high angular resolution and
                    often rely on limited snapshots, sometimes as scarce as a single snapshot.
                    Furthermore, the increasing interest in sparse arrays for automotive radar,
                    owing to their cost-effectiveness and reduced antenna element coupling,
                    presents additional challenges including susceptibility to random sensor
                    failures. This paper introduces a pioneering DL framework featuring a sparse
                    signal augmentation layer, meticulously crafted to bolster single snapshot DOA
                    estimation across diverse sparse array setups and amidst antenna failures. To
                    our best knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this issue. Our approach
                    improves the adaptability of deep learning techniques to overcome the unique
                    difficulties posed by sparse arrays with single snapshot. We conduct thorough
                    evaluations of our network's performance using simulated and real-world data,

                <p class="mathjax">The ``prediction + optimal control'' scheme has shown good performance in
                    many applications of automotive, traffic, robot, and building control. In
                    practice, the prediction results are simply considered correct in the optimal
                    control design process. However, in reality, these predictions may never be
                    perfect. Under a conventional stochastic optimal control formulation, it is
                    difficult to answer questions like ``what if the predictions are wrong''. This
                    paper presents an analysis framework for predictive optimal control where the
                    subjective belief about the future is no longer considered perfect. A novel
                    concept called the hidden prediction state is proposed to establish connections
                    among the predictors, the subjective beliefs, the control policies and the
                    objective control performance. Based on this framework, the predictor
                    evaluation problem is analyzed. Three commonly-used predictor evaluation
                    measures, including the mean squared error, the regret and the log-likelihood,
                    are considered. It is shown that neither using the mean square error nor using
                    the likelihood can guarantee a monotonic relationship between the predictor
                    error and the optimal control cost. To guarantee control cost improvement, it
                    is suggested the predictor should be evaluated with the control performance,
                    e.g., using the optimal control cost or the regret to evaluate predictors.
                    Numerical examples and examples from automotive applications with real-world
                    driving data are provided to illustrate the ideas and the results.

                    batteries can be harnessed to provide ramping and regulation services across
                    the grid. This paper concerns the problem of optimal allocation of different
                    classes of DERs, where each class is an aggregation of similar DERs, to balance
                    net-demand forecasts. The resulting resource allocation problem is solved using
                    model-predictive control (MPC) that utilizes a rolling sequence of finite
                    time-horizon constrained optimizations. This is based on the concept that we
                    have more accurate estimates of the load forecast in the short term, so each
                    optimization in the rolling sequence of optimization problems uses more
                    accurate short term load forecasts while ensuring satisfaction of capacity and
                    dynamical constraints. Simulations demonstrate that the MPC solution can indeed
                    reduce the ramping required from bulk generation, while mitigating near-real
                    time grid disturbances.

                <p class="mathjax">With the development of sixth generation (6G) networks toward digitalization
                    and intelligentization of communications, rapid and precise channel prediction
                    is crucial for the network potential release. Interestingly, a dynamic ray
                    tracing (DRT) approach for channel prediction has recently been proposed, which
                    utilizes the results of traditional RT to extrapolate the multipath geometry
                    evolution. However, both the priori environmental data and the regularity in
                    multipath evolution can be further utilized. In this work, an enhanced-dynamic
                    ray tracing (E-DRT) algorithm architecture based on multipath bidirectional
                    extrapolation has been proposed. In terms of accuracy, all available
                    environment information is utilized to predict the birth and death processes of
                    multipath components (MPCs) through bidirectional geometry extrapolation. In
                    terms of efficiency, bidirectional electric field extrapolation is employed
                    based on the evolution regularity of the MPCs' electric field. The results in a
                    Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenario show that E-DRT improves the accuracy of the
                    channel prediction from 68.3% to 94.8% while reducing the runtime by 7.2%
                    compared to DRT.

                <p class="mathjax">We consider the control design of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent
                    systems (MASs) under a global signal temporal logic (STL) specification to be
                    satisfied at a predefined probability. By decomposing the dynamics into
                    deterministic and error components, we construct a probabilistic reachable tube
                    (PRT) as the Cartesian product of reachable sets of the individual error
                    systems driven by disturbances lying in confidence regions (CRs) with a fixed
                    probability. By bounding the PRT probability with the specification
                    probability, we tighten all state constraints induced by the STL specification
                    by solving tractable optimization problems over segments of the PRT, and
                    convert the underlying stochastic problem into a deterministic one. This
                    approach reduces conservatism compared to tightening guided by the STL
                    structure. Additionally, we propose a recursively feasible algorithm to attack
                    the resulting problem by decomposing it into agent-level subproblems, which are
                    solved iteratively according to a scheduling policy. We demonstrate our method
                    on a ten-agent system, where existing approaches are impractical.

                <p class="mathjax">Brain tumor segmentation is a fundamental step in assessing a patient's
                    cancer progression. However, manual segmentation demands significant expert
                    time to identify tumors in 3D multimodal brain MRI scans accurately. This
                    reliance on manual segmentation makes the process prone to intra- and
                    inter-observer variability. This work proposes a brain tumor segmentation
                    method as part of the BraTS-GoAT challenge. The task is to segment tumors in
                    brain MRI scans automatically from various populations, such as adults,
                    pediatrics, and underserved sub-Saharan Africa. We employ a recent CNN
                    architecture for medical image segmentation, namely MedNeXt, as our baseline,
                    and we implement extensive model ensembling and postprocessing for inference.
                    Our experiments show that our method performs well on the unseen validation set
                    with an average DSC of 85.54% and HD95 of 27.88. The code is available on
                    https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/BraTS2024_BioMedIAMBZ.

                <p class="mathjax">Addressing the communication and sensing demands of sixth-generation (6G)
                    mobile communication system, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has
                    garnered traction in academia and industry. With the sensing limitation of
                    single base station (BS), multi-BS cooperative sensing is regarded as a
                    promising solution. The coexistence and overlapped coverage of macro BS (MBS)
                    and micro BS (MiBS) are common in the development of 6G, making the cooperative
                    sensing between MBS and MiBS feasible. Since MBS and MiBS work in low and high
                    frequency bands, respectively, the challenges of MBS and MiBS cooperative
                    sensing lie in the fusion method of the sensing information in high and
                    low-frequency bands. To this end, this paper introduces a symbol-level fusion
                    method and a grid-based three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3D-GDFT)
                    algorithm to achieve precise localization of multiple targets with limited
                    resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MBS and MiBS
                    cooperative sensing scheme outperforms traditional single BS (MBS/MiBS) sensing
                    scheme, showcasing superior sensing performance

                <p class="mathjax">Underwater communication networks are increasingly popularized by various
                    important maritime applications. However, this also leads to an increased
                    threat landscape. This letter presents the first study that considers jamming
                    attacks by random jammers present in the surroundings of legitimate
                    transceivers in underwater acoustic communication systems. We investigate the
                    impact of jamming attacks on various performance parameters of the legitimate
                    underwater acoustic communication link. In particular, we investigate the
                    legitimate link using stochastic geometry for important performance parameters,
                    namely coverage probability, average rate, and energy efficiency of the link
                    between two legitimate nodes, i.e., underwater and surface nodes. We then
                    derive and present tractable expressions for these performance parameters.
                    Finally, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to validate our analysis. We
                    plot the performance metrics against the transmit power, and jamming power for
                    different intensities of the jammers in shallow, mid, and deep water scenarios.
                    Results reveal that on average, jamming in deep water has a relatively high
                    impact on the performance of legitimate link than in shallow water.

                <p class="mathjax">Sparse Vector Coding (SVC) has long been considered an encoding method that
                    meets the URLLC QOS requirements. This encoding method has been widely studied
                    and applied due to its low encoding and decoding complexity, no pilot
                    transmission, resistance to inter-carrier interference, and low power
                    consumption. However, due to the use of position indexing, the encoding
                    essentially reduces the signal-to-noise ratio requirements by increasing the
                    communication bandwidth, which also leads to low encoding efficiency and strong
                    rigidity in decoding. Based on the sparse representation characteristics of
                    SVC, we propose a joint sparse representation encoding, namely Sparse Matrix
                    Coding (SMC). This encoding method utilizes multi-user information joint
                    encoding, and the sparsity and sparse locations between users are shared.

                <p class="mathjax">Given a time-series of noisy measured outputs of a dynamical system z[k],
                    k=1...N, the Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates (IRAS)
                    algorithm aims to find a non-trivial first integral of the system, namely, a
                    scalar function g() such that g(z[i]) = g(z[j]), for all i,j. IRAS has been
                    suggested recently and was used successfully in several learning tasks in
                    models from biology and physics. Here, we give the first rigorous analysis of
                    this algorithm in a specific setting. We assume that the observations admit a
                    linear first integral and that they are contaminated by Gaussian noise. We show
                    that in this case the IRAS iterations are closely related to the
                    self-consistent-field (SCF) iterations for solving a generalized Rayleigh
                    quotient minimization problem. Using this approach, we derive several
                    sufficient conditions guaranteeing local convergence of IRAS to the correct
                    first integral.

                <p class="mathjax">The temperature difference between soil and air holds the potential to
                    generate energy to power many low-power IoT devices. However, there is a lack
                    of studies in the literature that explore the nuances of soil-air thermal
                    energy harvesting. This paper offers a comprehensive discussion on soil-air
                    thermal energy harvesting. We engineer a custom Soil-air Thermoelectric
                    Generator (SoTEG) that incorporates an off-the-shelf TEG and an efficient heat
                    transfer network. A detailed discussion of the design and analysis of SoTEG is
                    presented along with a versatile simulation model which can be used to simulate
                    the performance of the harvester under different ambient conditions.
                    Investigations using the model and results gathered from experiments
                    demonstrate that the SoTEG has a heat transfer efficiency of 34.5% with room
                    for improvement and can power a load from temperature differences as low as 3
                    {\deg}C between soil and air, or 1 {\deg}C across the TEG. Power generated by
                    SoTEG at 3 {\deg}C difference amounts to 110 {\mu}Wor a power density of
                    11.58mW/m2. When connected to a Power Management Unit (PMU), the combined
                    system generates around 30 {\mu}Wat 3 {\deg}C. During a 14-day outdoor
                    deployment in a winter month, the maximum power generated by the combined
                    system is 337 {\mu}W when the temperature difference across the TEG is 2.75
                    {\deg}C. Additionally, the model analysis reveals that the weather conditions
                    have an impact on the harvester. While Solar radiation enhances power
                    generation, wind can either improve or diminish the harvested energy depending
                    on whether it is day or night.

                    (ESOs) typically assumes that the system is observable. This paper introduces
                    an improved method for systems that are initially unobservable, leveraging
                    Taylor expansion to approximate the integral of disturbance dynamics. A new
                    extended system is formulated based on this approximation, enabling the design

                <p class="mathjax">Efficient Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to accelerate SR network inference
                    by minimizing computational complexity and network parameters while preserving
                    performance. Existing state-of-the-art Efficient Image Super-Resolution methods
                    are based on convolutional neural networks. Few attempts have been made with
                    Mamba to harness its long-range modeling capability and efficient computational
                    complexity, which have shown impressive performance on high-level vision tasks.
                    In this paper, we propose DVMSR, a novel lightweight Image SR network that
                    incorporates Vision Mamba and a distillation strategy. The network of DVMSR
                    consists of three modules: feature extraction convolution, multiple stacked
                    Residual State Space Blocks (RSSBs), and a reconstruction module. Specifically,
                    the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual state space
                    blocks (RSSB), each of which has several Vision Mamba Moudles(ViMM) together
                    with a residual connection. To achieve efficiency improvement while maintaining
                    comparable performance, we employ a distillation strategy to the vision Mamba
                    network for superior performance. Specifically, we leverage the rich
                    representation knowledge of teacher network as additional supervision for the
                    output of lightweight student networks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
                    that our proposed DVMSR can outperform state-of-the-art efficient SR methods in
                    terms of model parameters while maintaining the performance of both PSNR and
                    SSIM. The source code is available at https://github.com/nathan66666/DVMSR.git

                <p class="mathjax">This paper considers a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
                    system where the downlink communication between a base station (BS) and
                    multiple user equipments (UEs) is aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface
                    (RIS). We study the sum-rate maximization problem with the objective of finding
                    the optimal precoding vectors and RIS configuration. Due to fronthaul
                    limitation, each entry of the precoding vectors must be picked from a finite
                    set of quantization labels. Furthermore, two scenarios for the RIS are
                    investigated, one with continuous infinite-resolution reflection coefficients
                    and another with discrete finite-resolution reflection coefficients. A novel
                    framework is developed which, in contrast to the common literature that only
                    offers sub-optimal solutions for optimization of discrete variables, is able to
                    find the optimal solution to problems involving discrete constraints. Based on
                    the classical weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), we transform the
                    original problem into an equivalent weighted sum mean square error (MSE)
                    minimization problem and solve it iteratively. We compute the optimal precoding
                    vectors via an efficient algorithm inspired by sphere decoding (SD). For
                    optimizing the discrete RIS configuration, two solutions based on the SD
                    algorithm are developed: An optimal SD-based algorithm and a low-complexity
                    heuristic method that can efficiently obtain RIS configuration without much
                    loss in optimality. The effectiveness of the presented algorithms is
                    corroborated via numerical simulations where it is shown that the proposed
                    designs are remarkably superior to the commonly used benchmarks.

                <p class="mathjax">Ultrasound tomography generally struggles to reconstruct high-contrast and/or
                    extended-range problems. A prime example is site-specific in-vivo bone imaging,
                    crucial for accurately assessing the risk of life-threatening fractures, which
                    are preventable given accurate diagnosis and treatment. In this type of
                    problem, two main obstacles arise: (a) an external region prohibits access to
                    the region of interest (ROI), and (b) high contrast exists between the two
                    regions. These challenges impede existing algorithms -- including bent-ray
                    tomography (BRT), known for its robustness, speed, and reasonable short-range
                    resolution. We propose Virtual Extended-Range Tomography (VERT), which tackles
                    these challenges through (a) placement of virtual transducers directly on the
                    ROI, facilitating (b) rapid initialisation before BRT inversion. In-silico
                    validation against BRT with and without a-priori information shows superior
                    resolution and robustness -- while maintaining or even improving speed. These
                    improvements are drastic where the external region is much larger than the ROI.
                    Additional validation against the practically impossible -- BRT directly on the
                    ROI -- demonstrates that VERT is approaching the resolution limit. The
                    capability to solve high-contrast extended-range tomography problems without
                    prior knowledge about the ROI's interior has many implications. VERT has the
                    potential to unlock site-specific in-vivo bone imaging for assessing fracture
                    risk, potentially saving millions of lives globally. In other applications,
                    VERT may replace classical BRT to yield improvements in resolution, robustness
                    and speed -- especially where the ROI does not cover the entire imaging array.
                    For even higher resolution, VERT offers a reliable starting background to
                    complement algorithms with less robustness and high computational costs.

                <p class="mathjax">We propose a Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) filter to extract anomalies
                    within data series generated by a broad class of proximity sensors, along with
                    the anomaly locations and their relative sizes. The technique applies to
                    devices commonly used in engineering practice, such as those mounted on mobile
                    robots for non-destructive inspection of hazardous or other environments that
                    may not be directly accessible to humans. The raw data generated by this class
                    of sensors can be challenging to analyze due to the prevalence of noise over
                    the signal content. The proposed filter is built to detect the difference of
                    information content between data series collected by the sensor and baseline
                    data series. It is applicable in a model-based or model-free context. The
                    performance of the KLD filter is validated in an industrial-norm setup and
                    benchmarked against a peer industrially-adopted algorithm.

                    Current methods for finding distributed Nash equilibrium require players to
                    send original messages to their neighbors, leading to communication burden and
                    privacy issues. To jointly address these issues, we propose an algorithm that
                    uses stochastic compression to save communication resources and conceal
                    information through random errors induced by compression. Our theoretical
                    analysis shows that the algorithm guarantees convergence accuracy, even with
                    aggressive compression errors used to protect privacy. We prove that the
                    algorithm achieves differential privacy through a stochastic quantization
                    scheme. Simulation results for energy consumption games support the
                    effectiveness of our approach.

                <p class="mathjax">Infrared pulse thermography non-destructive testing (NDT) method is developed
                    based on the difference in the infrared radiation intensity emitted by
                    defective and non-defective areas of an object. However, when the radiation
                    intensity of the defective target is similar to that of the non-defective area
                    of the object, the detection results are poor. To address this issue, this
                    study investigated the polarization characteristics of the infrared radiation
                    of different materials. Simulation results showed that the degree of infrared
                    polarization of the object surface changed regularly with changes in thermal
                    environment radiation. An infrared polarization imaging-based NDT method was
                    proposed and demonstrated using specimens with four different simulated
                    defective areas, which were designed and fabricated using four different
                    materials. The experimental results were consistent with the simulation
                    results, thereby proving the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared
                    with the infrared-radiation-intensity-based NDT method, the proposed method
                    improved the image detail presentation and detection accuracy.

                <p class="mathjax">This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in
                    collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically
                    adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order
                    to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs).
                    Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during
                    the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the
                    beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data
                    transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem,
                    because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the
                    pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of
                    channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical
                    solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper,
                    we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN)
                    to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically
                    received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the
                    AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data
                    transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of
                    uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink
                    beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and
                    downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to
                    account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant
                    and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the
                    existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.

                <p class="mathjax">The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic
                    scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However,
                    the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge
                    due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been
                    validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis
                    assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out
                    manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic
                    system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this
                    end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle
                    (UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate
                    landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An
                    affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area
                    to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks.
                    Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered
                    affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for
                    UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for
                    landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic
                    UCA and Cobb angle (R<span class="MathJax_Preview" style="display: none;"></span><span

                <p class="mathjax">Despite notable advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR),
                    performance tends to degrade when faced with adverse conditions. Generative
                    error correction (GER) leverages the exceptional text comprehension
                    capabilities of large language models (LLM), delivering impressive performance
                    in ASR error correction, where N-best hypotheses provide valuable information
                    for transcription prediction. However, GER encounters challenges such as fixed
                    N-best hypotheses, insufficient utilization of acoustic information, and
                    limited specificity to multi-accent scenarios. In this paper, we explore the
                    application of GER in multi-accent scenarios. Accents represent deviations from
                    standard pronunciation norms, and the multi-task learning framework for
                    simultaneous ASR and accent recognition (AR) has effectively addressed the
                    multi-accent scenarios, making it a prominent solution. In this work, we
                    propose a unified ASR-AR GER model, named MMGER, leveraging multi-modal
                    correction, and multi-granularity correction. Multi-task ASR-AR learning is
                    employed to provide dynamic 1-best hypotheses and accent embeddings.
                    Multi-modal correction accomplishes fine-grained frame-level correction by
                    force-aligning the acoustic features of speech with the corresponding
                    character-level 1-best hypothesis sequence. Multi-granularity correction
                    supplements the global linguistic information by incorporating regular 1-best
                    hypotheses atop fine-grained multi-modal correction to achieve coarse-grained
                    utterance-level correction. MMGER effectively mitigates the limitations of GER
                    and tailors LLM-based ASR error correction for the multi-accent scenarios.
                    Experiments conducted on the multi-accent Mandarin KeSpeech dataset demonstrate
                    the efficacy of MMGER, achieving a 26.72% relative improvement in AR accuracy
                    and a 27.55% relative reduction in ASR character error rate, compared to a
                    well-established standard baseline.

                <p class="mathjax">This study explores the practical viability of repurposing aging Kaplan
                    turbines into variable-speed propellers by employing full-size frequency
                    converters. The motivation behind this approach is to improve the provision of
                    \emph{Frequency Containment Reserve} (FCR) while reducing fatigue in the Kaplan
                    blades servomechanism. We evaluate the performance of these modified Kaplan
                    turbines against the one of another hydro asset composed of the same Kaplan
                    turbine hybridized with a \emph{Battery Energy Storage System} (BESS).
                    Experiments are conducted on a one-of-its-kind reduced-scale model testing
                    platform. Our findings reveal that Kaplan turbines repurposed as variable-speed
                    propellers exhibit similar dynamic response characteristics compared to the
                    standalone Kaplan operation, with the added benefit of effectively eliminating
                    blade movements. Furthermore, the ability to control the speed increases the
                    hydraulic efficiency for certain operating points. In summary, investment in
                    variable speed technology emerges as a viable alternative to BESS-based
                    hydropower hybridization.

                <p class="mathjax">Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly pervasive across various
                    domains, including wireless communication, where they extract insights from raw
                    radio signals. However, the computational demands of DL pose significant
                    challenges, particularly in distributed wireless networks like Cell-free
                    networks, where deploying DL models on edge devices becomes hard due to
                    heightened computational loads. These computational loads escalate with larger
                    input sizes, often correlating with improved model performance. To mitigate
                    this challenge, Early Exiting (EE) techniques have been introduced in DL,
                    primarily targeting the depth of the model. This approach enables models to
                    exit during inference based on specified criteria, leveraging entropy measures
                    at intermediate exits. Doing so makes less complex samples exit early, reducing
                    computational load and inference time. In our contribution, we propose a novel
                    width-wise exiting strategy for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based
                    architectures. By selectively adjusting the input size, we aim to regulate
                    computational demands effectively. Our approach aims to decrease the average
                    computational load during inference while maintaining performance levels
                    comparable to conventional models. We specifically investigate Modulation
                    Classification, a well-established application of DL in wireless communication.
                    Our experimental results show substantial reductions in computational load,
                    with an average decrease of 28%, and particularly notable reductions of 65% in
                    high-SNR scenarios. Through this work, we present a practical solution for
                    reducing computational demands in deep learning applications, particularly
                    within the domain of wireless communication.

                <p class="mathjax">In the era of Industry 4.0, smart factories have emerged as a paradigm shift,
                    redefining manufacturing with the integration of advanced digital technologies.
                    Central to this transformation is the deployment of 5G networks, offering
                    unprecedented levels of connectivity, speed, reliability, and ultra-low
                    latency. Among the revolutionary features of 5G is network slicing, a
                    technology that offers enhanced capabilities through the customization of
                    network resources by allowing multiple logical networks (or slices) to run on
                    top of a shared physical infrastructure. This capability is particularly
                    crucial in the densely packed and highly dynamic environment of smart
                    factories, where diverse applications - from robotic automation to real-time
                    analytics - demand varying network requirements. In this paper, we present a
                    comprehensive overview of the integration of slicing in smart factory networks,
                    emphasizing its critical role in enhancing operational efficiency and
                    supporting the diverse requirements of future manufacturing processes. We
                    elaborate on the recent advances, and technical scenarios, including indoor
                    factory propagation conditions, traffic characteristics, system requirements,
                    slice-aware radio resource management, network elements, enabling technologies
                    and current standardisation efforts. Additionally, we identify open research
                    challenges as well as key technical issues stifling deployments. Finally, we
                    speculate on the future trajectory of slicing-enabled smart factories,
                    emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to emerging technologies.

                <p class="mathjax">Event-triggered control is often argued to lower the average triggering rate
                    compared to time-triggered control while still achieving a desired control
                    goal, e.g., the same performance level. However, this property, often called
                    consistency, cannot be taken for granted and can be hard to analyze in many
                    settings. In particular, although numerous decentralized event-triggered
                    control schemes have been proposed in the past years, their performance
                    properties with respect to time-triggered control remain mostly unexplored. In
                    this paper, we therefore examine the performance properties of event-triggered
                    control (relative to time-triggered control) for a single-integrator consensus
                    problem with a level-triggering rule. We consider the long-term average
                    quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. For this setting,
                    we show that enriching the information the local controllers use improves the
                    performance of the consensus algorithm but renders a previously consistent
                    event-triggered control scheme inconsistent. In addition, we do so while
                    deploying optimal control inputs which we derive for both information cases and
                    all triggering schemes. With this insight, we can furthermore explain the
                    relationship between two contrasting consistency results from the literature on
                    decentralized event-triggered control. We support our theoretical findings with
                    simulation results.

                <p class="mathjax">Automatic assessment of dysarthria remains a highly challenging task due to
                    high variability in acoustic signals and the limited data. Currently, research
                    on the automatic assessment of dysarthria primarily focuses on two approaches:
                    one that utilizes expert features combined with machine learning, and the other
                    that employs data-driven deep learning methods to extract representations.
                    Research has demonstrated that expert features are effective in representing
                    pathological characteristics, while deep learning methods excel at uncovering
                    latent features. Therefore, integrating the advantages of expert features and
                    deep learning to construct a neural network architecture based on expert
                    knowledge may be beneficial for interpretability and assessment performance. In
                    this context, the present paper proposes a vowel graph attention network based
                    on audio-visual information, which effectively integrates the strengths of
                    expert knowledges and deep learning. Firstly, various features were combined as
                    inputs, including knowledge based acoustical features and deep learning based
                    pre-trained representations. Secondly, the graph network structure based on
                    vowel space theory was designed, allowing for a deep exploration of spatial
                    correlations among vowels. Finally, visual information was incorporated into
                    the model to further enhance its robustness and generalizability. The method
                    exhibited superior performance in regression experiments targeting Frenchay
                    scores compared to existing approaches.

                    for computing data-driven spatial filters in a distributed sensing platform
                    with limited bandwidth and computational resources, such as a wireless sensor
                    network. The convergence and optimality of the DASF algorithm has been
                    extensively studied under the assumption that an exact, but possibly
                    impractical solver for the local optimization problem at each updating node is
                    available. In this work, we provide convergence and optimality results for the

                    gradient descent or Newton's method. We provide sufficient conditions that the

                    neural networks in addressing the intricate challenges of convoluted
                    constraints arising from feedback linearization mapping. Our approach involves
                    a comprehensive procedure, encompassing the approximation of constraints
                    through a regression process. Subsequently, we transform these constraints into

                    integrating them into other stabilizing control architectures. The advantage
                    resides in the compatibility with the linear control design and the constraint

                <p class="mathjax">The energy market, and specifically the renewable sector carries volatility
                    and risks, similar to the financial market. Here, we leverage on a
                    well-established, return-risk approach, commonly used by equity
                    portfolio-managers and apply it to energy resources. We visualize the
                    relationship between the resources' costs and their risks in terms of efficient
                    frontiers. We apply this analysis to publically available data for various US
                    regions: Central, Eastern and Western coasts. Since risk management is
                    contingent on costs, this approach sheds useful light in assessing dynamic
                    pricing in modern electrical grids. By integrating geographical and temporal
                    dimensions into our research, we aim at providing more nuanced and

                <p class="mathjax">Physical Human-Machine Interaction plays a pivotal role in facilitating
                    collaboration across various domains. When designing appropriate model-based
                    controllers to assist a human in the interaction, the accuracy of the human
                    model is crucial for the resulting overall behavior of the coupled system. When
                    looking at state-of-the-art control approaches, most methods rely on a
                    deterministic model or no model at all of the human behavior. This poses a gap

                    which uses stochastic optimal control models that include signal-dependent
                    noise processes and therefore describe the human behavior much more accurate
                    than the deterministic counterparts. To close this gap by including these
                    stochastic human models in the control design, we introduce a novel design
                    methodology resulting in a Human-Variability-Respecting Optimal Control that
                    explicitly incorporates the human noise processes and their influence on the
                    mean and variability behavior of a physically coupled human-machine system. Our
                    approach results in an improved overall system performance, i.e. higher
                    accuracy and lower variability in target point reaching, while allowing to
                    shape the joint variability, for example to preserve human natural variability
                    patterns.

                <p class="mathjax">Channel estimation in quantized systems is challenging, particularly in
                    low-resolution systems. In this work, we propose to leverage a Gaussian mixture
                    model (GMM) as generative prior, capturing the channel distribution of the
                    propagation environment, to enhance a classical estimation technique based on
                    the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for one-bit quantization. Thereby,
                    a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the most responsible mixture component
                    is inferred for a quantized received signal, which is subsequently utilized in
                    the EM algorithm as side information. Numerical results demonstrate the
                    significant performance improvement of our proposed approach over both a
                    simplistic Gaussian prior and current state-of-the-art channel estimators.
                    Furthermore, the proposed estimation framework exhibits adaptability to higher
                    resolution systems and alternative generative priors.

                <p class="mathjax">Extreme temperature outages can lead to not just economic losses but also
                    various non-energy impacts (NEI) due to significant degradation of indoor
                    operating conditions caused by service disruptions. However, existing
                    resilience assessment approaches lack specificity for extreme temperature
                    conditions. They often overlook temperature-related mortality and neglect the
                    customer characteristics and grid response in the calculation, despite the
                    significant influence of these factors on NEI-related economic losses. This
                    paper aims to address these gaps by introducing a comprehensive framework to
                    estimate the impact of resilience enhancement not only on the direct economic
                    losses incurred by customers but also on potential NEI, including mortality and
                    the value of statistical life during extreme temperature-related outages. The
                    proposed resilience valuation integrates customer characteristics and grid
                    response variables based on a scalable grid simulation environment. This study
                    adopts a holistic approach to quantify customer-oriented economic impacts,
                    utilizing probabilistic loss scenarios that incorporate health-related factors
                    and damage/loss models as a function of exposure for valuation. The proposed
                    methodology is demonstrated through comparative resilient outage planning,
                    using grid response models emulating a Texas weather zone during the 2021
                    winter storm Uri. The case study results show that enhanced outage planning
                    with hardened infrastructure can improve the system resilience and thereby
                    reduce the relative risk of mortality by 16% and save the total costs related
                    to non-energy impacts by 74%. These findings underscore the efficacy of the
                    framework by assessing the financial implications of each case, providing
                    valuable insights for decision-makers and stakeholders involved in
                    extreme-weather related resilience planning for risk management and mitigation
                    strategies.

                <p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a novel pulse shaping design for single-carrier
                    integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmission. Due to the
                    communication information embedded in the ISAC signal, the resulting
                    auto-correlation function (ACF) is determined by both the information-conveying
                    random symbol sequence and the signaling pulse, where the former leads to
                    random fluctuations in the sidelobes of the ACF, impairing the range estimation
                    performance. To overcome this challenge, we first analyze the statistical
                    characteristics of the random ACF under the symbol-wise pulse shaping (SWPS)
                    regime. As a step further, we formulate an optimization problem to design ISAC
                    pulse shaping filters, which minimizes the average integrated sidelobe level
                    ratio (ISLR) while meeting the Nyquist criterion, subject to power and
                    bandwidth constraints. We then show that the problem can be recast as a convex
                    quadratic program by expressing it in the frequency domain, which can be
                    readily solved through standard tools. Numerical results demonstrate that the
                    proposed pulse shaping design achieves substantial ranging sidelobe reduction
                    compared to the celebrated root-raised cosine (RRC) pulse shaping, given that
                    the communication throughput is unchanged.

                    secure communication protocols. In this work, we propose a novel physical layer
                    authentication (PLA)-based challenge-response (CR) protocol in which a drone
                    Bob authenticates the sender (either on the ground or air) by exploiting his
                    prior knowledge of the wireless channel statistic (fading, path loss, and
                    shadowing). In particular, Bob will move to a set of positions in the space,
                    and by estimating the attenuations of the received signals he will authenticate
                    the sender. We take into account the energy consumption in the design and
                    provide three solutions: a purely greedy solution (PG), an optimal Bellman
                    iterative solution (BI), and a heuristic solution based on the evaluation of
                    the standard deviation of the attenuations in the space. Finally, we

                    BIoT and the storage of data at BIoT agents. This paper focuses on developing a
                    performance guarantee for the distributed estimation in a BIoT in the presence
                    of malicious attacks which jointly exploits vulnerabilities present in both IoT
                    devices and the employed blockchain within the BIoT. To achieve this, we adopt
                    the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) as the performance metric, and maximize the CRB for
                    estimating the parameter of interest over the attack domain. However, the
                    maximization problem is inherently non-convex, making it infeasible to obtain
                    the globally optimal solution in general. To address this issue, we develop a
                    relaxation method capable of transforming the original non-convex optimization
                    problem into a convex optimization problem. Moreover, we derive the analytical
                    expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed optimization problem. The
                    optimal value of the relaxed optimization problem can be used to provide a
                    valid estimation performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks.

                <p class="mathjax">The ability to detect when a system undergoes an incipient fault is of
                    paramount importance in preventing a critical failure. In this work, we propose
                    an information-driven fault detection method based on a novel concept drift
                    detector. The method is tailored to identifying drifts in input-output
                    relationships of additive noise models (i.e., model drifts) and is based on a
                    distribution-free mutual information (MI) estimator. Our scheme does not
                    require prior faulty examples and can be applied distribution-free over a large
                    class of system models. Our core contributions are twofold. First, we
                    demonstrate the connection between fault detection, model drift detection, and
                    testing independence between two random variables. Second, we prove several
                    theoretical properties of the proposed MI-based fault detection scheme: (i)
                    strong consistency, (ii) exponentially fast detection of the non-faulty case,
                    and (iii) control of both significance levels and power of the test. To
                    conclude, we validate our theory with synthetic data and the benchmark dataset
                    N-CMAPSS of aircraft turbofan engines. These empirical results support the
                    usefulness of our methodology in many practical and realistic settings, and the
                    theoretical results show performance guarantees that other methods cannot
                    offer.

                <p class="mathjax">We introduce a novel, all-in-one deep learning framework for MR image
                    reconstruction, enabling a single model to enhance image quality across
                    multiple aspects of k-space sampling and to be effective across a wide range of
                    clinical and technical scenarios. This DICOM-based algorithm serves as the core
                    of SwiftMR (AIRS Medical, Seoul, Korea), which is FDA-cleared, CE-certified,
                    and commercially available. We first detail the comprehensive development
                    process of the model, including data collection, training pair preparation,
                    model architecture design, and DICOM inference. We then assess the model's
                    capability to enhance image quality in a multi-dimensional manner, specifically
                    across various aspects of k-space sampling. Subsequently, we evaluate several
                    features of the multi-dimensional enhancement: the accuracy of tunable
                    denoising, the effectiveness of super-resolution in each encoding direction,
                    and the reduction of artifacts that become more prominent at lower spatial
                    resolutions. Additionally, we assess its compatibility with various scan
                    parameter sets and its generalizability across scanner vendors not seen during
                    training. Finally, we present specific cases demonstrating the model's utility
                    in reducing scan time across anatomical regions in conjunction with protocol
                    optimization. The proposed model is compatible with a broad spectrum of
                    scenarios, including various vendors, pulse sequences, scan parameters, and
                    anatomical regions. Its DICOM-based operation particularly enhances its
                    applicability for real-world applications. Given its demonstrated effectiveness
                    and versatility, we expect its use to expand in the field of clinical MRI.

                <p class="mathjax">This report details the design and optimisation of a water-cooled forced
                    convection heat dissipation system for use in high-temperature applications
                    (ranges between 700 degrees - 1000 degrees K). A hollow cuboid vapour chamber
                    model was investigated. The space within the hollow cuboid was used as the
                    design space. COMSOL, a FEM software product was used to solve for the physical
                    parameters of each geometry for the heat dissipation system design space.
                    COMSOL in conjunction with MATLAB was used for the parametric and density-based
                    topology optimisation of the geometric design in the design space. The goal of
                    the optimization is the minimisation of a temperature gradient over the design
                    space. This allows the heat to be evenly spread throughout the designed mesh
                    which allows for more effective cooling. To reduce the computational time
                    needed to solve and optimise each geometry in 3D, a 2D representation was
                    created for the front and rear faces of the hollow cuboid setup. These 2D face
                    designs were then extrapolated into 3D over the length of the hollow cube and
                    COMSOL was used to find a solution for each model. This report also proposes a
                    use case for this system wherein it would be used in conjunction with MGA and
                    thermometric technology within coal-fired power stations for the extraction and
                    storage of waste heat for later use.

                <p class="mathjax">Image captioning models are widely used to describe recent and archived
                    pictures with the objective of improving their accessibility and retrieval.
                    Yet, these approaches tend to be inefficient and biased at retrieving people's
                    names. In this work we introduce AstroCaptions, a dataset for the image
                    captioning task. This dataset specifically contains thousands of public
                    fig-ures that are complex to identify for a traditional model. We also propose
                    a novel post-processing method to insert identified people's names inside the
                    caption using explainable AI tools and the grounding capabilities of
                    vi-sion-language models. The results obtained with this method show
                    signifi-cant improvements of captions quality and a potential of reducing
                    halluci-nations. Up to 93.2% of the persons detected can be inserted in the
                    image captions leading to improvements in the BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr and METEOR

                    YOLOv8 for three distinct classes: artemia, cyst, and excrement. In this
                    comparative study, we analyze the performance of these models in terms of
                    accuracy, precision, recall, etc. where YOLOv5 often performed better in
                    detecting Artemia and cysts with excellent precision and accuracy. However,
                    when it came to detecting excrement, YOLOv5 faced notable challenges and
                    limitations. This suggests that YOLOv8 offers greater versatility and
                    adaptability in detection tasks while YOLOv5 may struggle in difficult

                <p class="mathjax">The paper develops datasets and methods to assess student participation in
                    real-life collaborative learning environments. In collaborative learning
                    environments, students are organized into small groups where they are free to
                    interact within their group. Thus, students can move around freely causing
                    issues with strong pose variation, move out and re-enter the camera scene, or
                    face away from the camera. We formulate the problem of assessing student
                    participation into two subproblems: (i) student group detection against strong
                    background interference from other groups, and (ii) dynamic participant
                    tracking within the group. A massive independent testing dataset of 12,518,250
                    student label instances, of total duration of 21 hours and 22 minutes of
                    real-life videos, is used for evaluating the performance of our proposed method
                    for student group detection. The proposed method of using multiple image
                    representations is shown to perform equally or better than YOLO on all video
                    instances. Over the entire dataset, the proposed method achieved an F1 score of
                    0.85 compared to 0.80 for YOLO. Following student group detection, the paper
                    presents the development of a dynamic participant tracking system for assessing
                    student group participation through long video sessions. The proposed dynamic
                    participant tracking system is shown to perform exceptionally well, missing a
                    student in just one out of 35 testing videos. In comparison, a state of the art
                    method fails to track students in 14 out of the 35 testing videos. The proposed
                    method achieves 82.3% accuracy on an independent set of long, real-life
                    collaborative videos.

                <p class="mathjax">To satisfy the growing throughput demand of data-intensive applications, the
                    performance of optical communication systems increased dramatically in recent
                    years. With higher throughput, more advanced equalizers are crucial, to
                    compensate for impairments caused by inter-symbol interference (ISI). The
                    latest research shows that artificial neural network (ANN)-based equalizers are
                    promising candidates to replace traditional algorithms for high-throughput
                    communications. On the other hand, not only throughput but also flexibility is
                    a main objective of beyond-5G and 6G communication systems. A platform that is
                    able to satisfy the strict throughput and flexibility requirements of modern
                    communication systems are field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Thus, in this
                    work, we present a high-performance FPGA implementation of an ANN-based
                    equalizer, which meets the throughput requirements of modern optical
                    communication systems. Further, our architecture is highly flexible since it
                    includes a variable degree of parallelism (DOP) and therefore can also be
                    applied to low-cost or low-power applications which is demonstrated for a
                    magnetic recording channel. The implementation is based on a cross-layer design
                    approach featuring optimizations from the algorithm down to the hardware
                    architecture, including a detailed quantization analysis. Moreover, we present
                    a framework to reduce the latency of the ANN-based equalizer under given
                    throughput constraints. As a result, the bit error ratio (BER) of our equalizer
                    for the optical fiber channel is around four times lower than that of a
                    conventional one, while the corresponding FPGA implementation achieves a
                    throughput of more than 40 GBd, outperforming a high-performance graphics
                    processing unit (GPU) by three orders of magnitude for a similar batch size.

                <p class="mathjax">This document briefly describes the noise models and shapes used for the
                    synthesis of the Drag-Free and Attitude Control System in the LISA space
                    mission. LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is one of the next
                    large-class missions from the European Space Agency (ESA), expected to be
                    launched in 2034. The main goal of the mission is to detect the gravitational
                    waves, which are undulatory perturbations of the space-time fabric, extremely
                    important to collect experimental proofs for the General Relativity Theory. In
                    the 90s, different international collaborations of institutes laid the
                    foundations for the first ground-based interferometers (see, e.g., LIGO and
                    Virgo). However, ground-based interferometers have a limited bandwidth due to
                    the Earth's environmental noises and short arm-length of few kilometers.
                    Therefore, they cannot observe gravitational waves belonging to the portion of
                    the spectrum below 1 Hz. This issue can be overcome by means of space-based
                    interferometers, that can have arm-lengths up to millions of kilometers and
                    exploit a quieter environment than the Earth's surface. The LISA system is
                    affected by actuation, sensing and environmental disturbances and noises. Among
                    the actuation noises we have those given by the Micro Propulsion System (MPS),
                    the Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS) and the Optical Assembly (OA) motor.
                    Among the sensing noises we consider the interferometer, the Differential
                    Wavefront Sensor (DWS) and the GRS. The environmental disturbances are given by
                    the solar radiation pressure, the test-mass stiffness and self-gravity, and the
                    environmental noises acting directly on the test-mass.

                    theoretical frameworks like integrated information theory (IIT) within
                    neuroscience and the philosophy of mind. This paper explores the potential for
                    artificial consciousness by merging neuromorphic design and architecture with
                    brain simulations. It proposes the Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial
                    Consciousness (NCAC) as a theoretical framework. While the debate on artificial
                    consciousness remains contentious due to our incomplete grasp of consciousness,
                    this work may raise eyebrows and invite criticism. Nevertheless, this
                    optimistic and forward-thinking approach is fueled by insights from the Human
                    Brain Project, advancements in brain imaging like EEG and fMRI, and recent
                    strides in AI and computing, including quantum and neuromorphic designs.
                    Additionally, this paper outlines how machine learning can play a role in
                    crafting artificial consciousness, aiming to realise machine consciousness and
                    awareness in the future.

                <p class="mathjax">Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) propose the idea that a
                    sequence of layers in a neural network is just a discretisation of an ODE, and
                    thus can instead be directly modelled by a parameterised ODE. This idea has had
                    resounding success in the deep learning literature, with direct or indirect
                    influence in many state of the art ideas, such as diffusion models or time
                    dependant models. Recently, a continuous version of the U-net architecture has
                    been proposed, showing increased performance over its discrete counterpart in
                    many imaging applications and wrapped with theoretical guarantees around its
                    performance and robustness. In this work, we explore the use of Neural ODEs for
                    learned inverse problems, in particular with the well-known Learned Primal Dual
                    algorithm, and apply it to computed tomography (CT) reconstruction.

                <p class="mathjax">In this letter, we study interleave frequency division multiplexing (IFDM)
                    for multicarrier modulation in static multipath and mobile time-varying
                    channels, which outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM),
                    orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division
                    multiplexing (AFDM) by considering practical advanced detectors. The
                    fundamental principle underlying existing modulation techniques is to establish
                    sparse equivalent channel matrices in order to facilitate the design of
                    low-complexity detection algorithms for signal recovery, making a trade-off
                    between performance and implementation complexity. In contrast, the proposed
                    IFDM establishes an equivalent fully dense and right-unitarily invariant
                    channel matrix with the goal of achieving channel capacity, ensuring that the
                    signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. Meanwhile, a
                    low-complexity and replica maximum a posteriori (MAP)-optimal cross-domain
                    memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for IFDM by
                    exploiting the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the unitary invariance
                    in interleave-frequency-domain channel. Numerical results show that IFDM with
                    extremely low-complexity CD-MAMP outperforms OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM with
                    state-of-the-art orthogonal approximate message passing detectors, particularly
                    at low velocities.

                <p class="mathjax">Rock mass classification systems are crucial for assessing stability and risk
                    in underground construction globally and guiding support and excavation design.
                    However, systems developed primarily in the 1970s lack access to modern
                    high-resolution data and advanced statistical techniques, limiting their
                    effectiveness as decision-support systems. Initially, we outline the
                    limitations observed in this context and later describe how a data-driven
                    system, based on drilling data as detailed in this study, can overcome these
                    limitations. Using extracted statistical information from thousands of MWD-data
                    values in one-meter sections of a full tunnel profile, thus working as a
                    signature of the rock mass, we have demonstrated that it is possible to form
                    well-defined clusters that can act as a foundational basis for various rock
                    mass classification systems. We reduced the dimensionality of 48-value vectors
                    using nonlinear manifold learning techniques (UMAP) and linear principal
                    component analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering. Unsupervised machine learning
                    methods (HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, K-means) were employed to cluster
                    the data, with hyperparameters optimised through multi-objective Bayesian
                    optimisation for effective clustering. Using domain knowledge, we experienced
                    improved clustering and system tuning opportunities in adding extra features to
                    core clusters of MWD-data. We structured and correlated these clusters with
                    physical rock mass properties, including labels of rock type and rock quality,
                    and analysed cumulative distributions of key MWD-parameters for rock mass
                    assessment to determine if clusters meaningfully differentiate rock masses. The
                    ability of MWD data to form distinct rock mass clusters suggests substantial
                    potential for future classification systems grounded in this objective,
                    data-driven methodology, free from human bias.

                <p class="mathjax">Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is a brand new chirp-based
                    multi-carrier (MC) waveform for high mobility communications, with promising
                    advantages over Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other MC
                    waveforms. Existing AFDM research focuses on wireless communication at high
                    carrier frequency (CF), which typically considers only Doppler frequency shift
                    (DFS) as a result of mobility, while ignoring the accompanied Doppler time
                    scaling (DTS) on waveform. However, for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication
                    at much lower CF and propagating at speed of sound, the DTS effect could not be
                    ignored and poses significant challenges for channel estimation. This paper
                    analyzes the channel frequency response (CFR) of AFDM under multi-scale
                    multi-lag (MSML) channels, where each propagating path could have different
                    delay and DFS/DTS. Based on the newly derived input-output formula and its
                    characteristics, two new channel estimation methods are proposed, i.e., AFDM
                    with iterative multi-index (AFDM-IMI) estimation under low to moderate DTS, and
                    AFDM with orthogonal matching pursuit (AFDM-OMP) estimation under high DTS.
                    Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods against the
                    original AFDM channel estimation method. Moreover, the resulted AFDM system
                    outperforms OFDM as well as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) in
                    terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER), which is
                    consistent with our theoretical analysis based on CFR overlap probability
                    (COP), mutual incoherent property (MIP) and channel diversity gain under MSML
                    channels.

                <p class="mathjax">This paper addresses the challenge of learning to recite the Quran for
                    non-Arabic speakers. We explore the possibility of crowdsourcing a carefully
                    annotated Quranic dataset, on top of which AI models can be built to simplify
                    the learning process. In particular, we use the volunteer-based crowdsourcing
                    genre and implement a crowdsourcing API to gather audio assets. We integrated
                    the API into an existing mobile application called NamazApp to collect audio
                    recitations. We developed a crowdsourcing platform called Quran Voice for
                    annotating the gathered audio assets. As a result, we have collected around
                    7000 Quranic recitations from a pool of 1287 participants across more than 11
                    non-Arabic countries, and we have annotated 1166 recitations from the dataset
                    in six categories. We have achieved a crowd accuracy of 0.77, an inter-rater
                    agreement of 0.63 between the annotators, and 0.89 between the labels assigned
                    by the algorithm and the expert judgments.

                <p class="mathjax">In this study, we introduce Spider RIS technology, which offers an innovative
                    solution to the challenges encountered in movable antennas (MAs) and unmanned
                    aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication systems. By combining the dynamic
                    adaptation capability of MAs and the flexible location advantages of UAVs, this
                    technology offers a dynamic and movable RIS, which can flexibly optimize
                    physical locations within the two-dimensional movement platform. Spider RIS
                    aims to enhance the communication efficiency and reliability of wireless
                    networks, particularly in obstructive environments, by elevating the signal
                    quality and achievable rate. The motivation of Spider RIS is based on the
                    ability to fully exploit the spatial variability of wireless channels and
                    maximize channel capacity even with a limited number of reflecting elements by
                    overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed RIS and energy-intensive UAV
                    systems. Considering the geometry-based millimeter wave channel model, we
                    present the design of a three-stage angular-based hybrid beamforming system
                    empowered by Spider RIS: First, analog beamformers are designed using angular
                    information, followed by the generation of digital precoder/combiner based on
                    the effective channel observed from baseband stage. Subsequently, the joint
                    dynamic positioning with phase shift design of the Spider RIS is optimized
                    using particle swarm optimization, maximizing the achievable rate of the
                    systems.

                <p class="mathjax">The radio spectrum is a limited resource. Demand for wireless communication
                    services is increasing exponentially, stressing the availability of radio
                    spectrum to accommodate new services. TV White Space (TVWS) technologies allow
                    a dynamic usage of the spectrum. These technologies provide wireless
                    connectivity, in the channels of the Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High
                    Frequency (UHF) television broadcasting bands. In this paper, we investigate
                    and compare the coverage range, network capacity, and network energy efficiency
                    for TVWS technologies and LTE. We consider Ghent, Belgium and Boyeros, Havana,
                    Cuba to evaluate a realistic outdoor suburban and rural area, respectively. The
                    comparison shows that TVWS networks have an energy efficiency 9-12 times higher
                    than LTE networks.

                <p class="mathjax">Widespread deployment of societal-scale machine learning systems necessitates
                    a thorough understanding of the resulting long-term effects these systems have
                    on their environment, including loss of trustworthiness, bias amplification,
                    and violation of AI safety requirements. We introduce a repeated learning
                    process to jointly describe several phenomena attributed to unintended hidden
                    feedback loops, such as error amplification, induced concept drift, echo
                    chambers and others. The process comprises the entire cycle of obtaining the
                    data, training the predictive model, and delivering predictions to end-users
                    within a single mathematical model. A distinctive feature of such repeated
                    learning setting is that the state of the environment becomes causally
                    dependent on the learner itself over time, thus violating the usual assumptions
                    about the data distribution. We present a novel dynamical systems model of the
                    repeated learning process and prove the limiting set of probability
                    distributions for positive and negative feedback loop modes of the system
                    operation. We conduct a series of computational experiments using an exemplary
                    supervised learning problem on two synthetic data sets. The results of the
                    experiments correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from the
                    dynamical model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
                    approach for studying the repeated learning processes in machine learning
                    systems and open a range of opportunities for further research in the area.

                <p class="mathjax">In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal
                    trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented
                    trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is
                    reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal
                    control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the
                    Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting
                    It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire
                    spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous
                    technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory
                    optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem
                    that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be
                    quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear
                    transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be
                    it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time
                    conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for
                    formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an
                    unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented
                    trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery
                    caused by uncertainties and failures.

                <p class="mathjax">In recent years, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has witnessed rapid
                    advancements, facilitating the generation of music, images, and other forms of
                    artistic expression across various industries. However, researches on general
                    multi-modal music generation model remain scarce. To fill this gap, we propose
                    a multi-modal music generation framework Mozart's Touch. It could generate
                    aligned music with the cross-modality inputs, such as images, videos and text.
                    Mozart's Touch is composed of three main components: Multi-modal Captioning
                    Module, Large Language Model (LLM) Understanding &amp; Bridging Module, and Music
                    Generation Module. Unlike traditional approaches, Mozart's Touch requires no
                    training or fine-tuning pre-trained models, offering efficiency and
                    transparency through clear, interpretable prompts. We also introduce
                    "LLM-Bridge" method to resolve the heterogeneous representation problems
                    between descriptive texts of different modalities. We conduct a series of
                    objective and subjective evaluations on the proposed model, and results
                    indicate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art
                    models. Our codes and examples is availble at:

                <p class="mathjax">Sim2real transfer has received increasing attention lately due to the success
                    of learning robotic tasks in simulation end-to-end. While there has been a lot
                    of progress in transferring vision-based navigation policies, the existing
                    sim2real strategy for audio-visual navigation performs data augmentation
                    empirically without measuring the acoustic gap. The sound differs from light in
                    that it spans across much wider frequencies and thus requires a different
                    solution for sim2real. We propose the first treatment of sim2real for
                    audio-visual navigation by disentangling it into acoustic field prediction
                    (AFP) and waypoint navigation. We first validate our design choice in the
                    SoundSpaces simulator and show improvement on the Continuous AudioGoal
                    navigation benchmark. We then collect real-world data to measure the spectral
                    difference between the simulation and the real world by training AFP models
                    that only take a specific frequency subband as input. We further propose a
                    frequency-adaptive strategy that intelligently selects the best frequency band
                    for prediction based on both the measured spectral difference and the energy
                    distribution of the received audio, which improves the performance on the real
                    data. Lastly, we build a real robot platform and show that the transferred
                    policy can successfully navigate to sounding objects. This work demonstrates
                    the potential of building intelligent agents that can see, hear, and act
                    entirely from simulation, and transferring them to the real world.

                    offers increased flexibility for future communication systems by exploiting
                    previously untapped degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The
                    representation of the traditional spatial domain channel state information
                    (sCSI) limits the insights into the potential of EM domain channel properties,
                    constraining the base station's (BS) utmost capability for precoding design.
                    This paper leverages the EM domain channel state information (eCSI) for
                    radiation pattern design at the BS. We develop an orthogonal decomposition
                    method based on spherical harmonic functions to decompose the radiation pattern
                    into a linear combination of orthogonal bases. By formulating the radiation
                    pattern design as an optimization problem for the projection coefficients over
                    these bases, we develop a manifold optimization-based method for iterative
                    radiation pattern and digital precoder design. To address the eCSI estimation
                    problem, we capitalize on the inherent structure of the channel. Specifically,
                    we propose a subspace-based scheme to reduce the pilot overhead for wideband
                    sCSI estimation. Given the estimated full-band sCSI, we further employ
                    parameterized methods for angle of arrival estimation. Subsequently, the
                    complete eCSI can be reconstructed after estimating the equivalent channel gain
                    via the least squares method. Simulation results demonstrate that, in
                    comparison to traditional mMIMO systems with fixed antenna radiation patterns,
                    the proposed RmMIMO architecture offers significant throughput gains for
                    multi-user transmission at a low channel estimation overhead.

                    either. Our approach
                    focuses on detectors that are based on the correlation and energy of the
                    received signal, which are motivated by implementation simplicity. We optimize
                    the detector parameters to achieve the best trade-off between missed-detection
                    and false-alarm error exponents. First, we optimize the detectors for a given
                    signal, resulting in a non-linear relation between the signal and correlator
                    weights to be optimized. Subsequently, we optimize the transmitted signal and
                    the detector parameters jointly, revealing that the optimal signal is a
                    balanced ternary signal and the correlator has at most three different
                    coefficients, thus facilitating a computationally feasible solution.

                <p class="mathjax">We propose a high-performance glass-plastic hybrid minimalist aspheric
                    panoramic annular lens (ASPAL) to solve several major limitations of the
                    traditional panoramic annular lens (PAL), such as large size, high weight, and
                    complex system. The field of view (FoV) of the ASPAL is
                    360{\deg}x(35{\deg}~110{\deg}) and the imaging quality is close to the
                    diffraction limit. This large FoV ASPAL is composed of only 4 lenses. Moreover,
                    we establish a physical structure model of PAL using the ray tracing method and
                    study the influence of its physical parameters on compactness ratio. In
                    addition, for the evaluation of local tolerances of annular surfaces, we
                    propose a tolerance analysis method suitable for ASPAL. This analytical method
                    can effectively analyze surface irregularities on annular surfaces and provide
                    clear guidance on manufacturing tolerances for ASPAL. Benefiting from
                    high-precision glass molding and injection molding aspheric lens manufacturing
                    techniques, we finally manufactured 20 ASPALs in small batches. The weight of
                    an ASPAL prototype is only 8.5 g. Our framework provides promising insights for
                    the application of panoramic systems in space and weight-constrained
                    environmental sensing scenarios such as intelligent security, micro-UAVs, and
                    micro-robots.

                <p class="mathjax">Due to the ever-increasing availability of video surveillance cameras and the
                    growing need for crime prevention, the violence detection task is attracting
                    greater attention from the research community. With respect to other action
                    recognition tasks, violence detection in surveillance videos shows additional
                    issues, such as the presence of a significant variety of real fight scenes.
                    Unfortunately, available datasets seem to be very small compared with other
                    action recognition datasets. Moreover, in surveillance applications, people in
                    the scenes always differ for each video and the background of the footage
                    differs for each camera. Also, violent actions in real-life surveillance videos
                    must be detected quickly to prevent unwanted consequences, thus models would
                    definitely benefit from a reduction in memory usage and computational costs.
                    Such problems make classical action recognition methods difficult to be
                    adopted. To tackle all these issues, we introduce JOSENet, a novel
                    self-supervised framework that provides outstanding performance for violence
                    detection in surveillance videos. The proposed model receives two
                    spatiotemporal video streams, i.e., RGB frames and optical flows, and involves
                    a new regularized self-supervised learning approach for videos. JOSENet
                    provides improved performance compared to self-supervised state-of-the-art
                    methods, while requiring one-fourth of the number of frames per video segment
                    and a reduced frame rate. The source code and the instructions to reproduce our
                    experiments are available at https://github.com/ispamm/JOSENet.

                <p class="mathjax">With the increase in data volume, more types of data are being used and
                    shared, especially in the power Internet of Things (IoT). However, the
                    processes of data sharing may lead to unexpected information leakage because of
                    the ubiquitous relevance among the different data, thus it is necessary for
                    data owners to conduct preventive audits for data applications before data
                    sharing to avoid the risk of key information leakage. Considering that the same
                    data may play completely different roles in different application scenarios,
                    data owners should know the expected data applications of the data buyers in
                    advance and provide modified data that are less relevant to the private
                    information of the data owners and more relevant to the nonprivate information
                    that the data buyers need. In this paper, data sharing in the power IoT is
                    regarded as the background, and the mutual information of the data and their
                    implicit information is selected as the data feature parameter to indicate the
                    relevance between the data and their implicit information or the ability to
                    infer the implicit information from the data. Therefore, preventive audits
                    should be conducted based on changes in the data feature parameters before and
                    after data sharing. The probability exchange adjustment method is proposed as
                    the theoretical basis of preventive audits under simplified consumption, and
                    the corresponding optimization models are constructed and extended to more
                    practical scenarios with multivariate characteristics. Finally, case studies
                    are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed preventive audits.

                <p class="mathjax">This work considers the problem of optimal lane changing in a structured
                    multi-agent road environment. A novel motion planning algorithm that can
                    capture long-horizon dependencies as well as short-horizon dynamics is
                    presented. Pivotal to our approach is a geometric approximation of the
                    long-horizon combinatorial transition problem which we formulate in the
                    continuous time-space domain. Moreover, a discrete-time formulation of a
                    short-horizon optimal motion planning problem is formulated and combined with
                    the long-horizon planner. Both individual problems, as well as their
                    combination, are formulated as MIQP and solved in real-time by using
                    state-of-the-art solvers. We show how the presented algorithm outperforms two
                    other state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms in closed-loop performance
                    and computation time in lane changing problems. Evaluations are performed using
                    the traffic simulator SUMO, a custom low-level tracking model predictive
                    controller, and high-fidelity vehicle models and scenarios, provided by the
                    CommonRoad environment.

                <p class="mathjax">In this study, we propose a new approach to compute the majority vote (MV)
                    function based on modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ) and introduce
                    three different methods. The proposed methods rely on the fact that when a
                    linear combination of polynomials is evaluated at one of the roots of a
                    polynomial in the combination, that polynomial does contribute to the
                    evaluation. To utilize this property, each transmitter maps the votes to the
                    zeros of a Huffman polynomial, and the corresponding polynomial coefficients
                    are transmitted. The receiver evaluates the polynomial constructed by the
                    elements of the superposed sequence at conjugate-reciprocal zero pairs and
                    detects the MV with a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. With differential
                    and index-based encoders, we eliminate the need for power-delay information at
                    the receiver while improving the computation error rate (CER) performance. The
                    proposed methods do not use instantaneous channel state information at the
                    transmitters and receiver. Thus, they provide robustness against phase and time
                    synchronization errors. We theoretically analyze the CERs of the proposed
                    methods. Finally, we demonstrate their efficacy in a distributed median
                    computation scenario in a fading channel.

                <p class="mathjax">There is an upward trend of deploying distributed energy resource management
                    systems (DERMS) to control modern power grids. However, DERMS controller
                    communication lines are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could potentially
                    impact operational reliability. While a data-driven intrusion detection system
                    (IDS) can potentially thwart attacks during deployment, also known as the
                    evasion attack, the training of the detection algorithm may be corrupted by
                    adversarial data injected into the database, also known as the poisoning
                    attack. In this paper, we propose the first framework of IDS that is robust
                    against joint poisoning and evasion attacks. We formulate the defense mechanism
                    as a bilevel optimization, where the inner and outer levels deal with attacks
                    that occur during training time and testing time, respectively. We verify the
                    robustness of our method on the IEEE-13 bus feeder model against a diverse set
                    of poisoning and evasion attack scenarios. The results indicate that our
                    proposed method outperforms the baseline technique in terms of accuracy,
                    precision, and recall for intrusion detection.

                    scenarios. Many works have analyzed and extended the original SRP method to
                    reduce its computational cost, to allow it to locate multiple sources, or to
                    improve its performance in adverse environments. In this work, we review over
                    200 papers on the SRP method and its variants, with emphasis on the SRP-PHAT
                    method. We also present eXtensible-SRP, or X-SRP, a generalized and modularized
                    version of the SRP algorithm which allows the reviewed extensions to be
                    implemented. We provide a Python implementation of the algorithm which includes
                    selected extensions from the literature.

                <p class="mathjax">Recent advancements in AI have democratized its deployment as a healthcare
                    assistant. While pretrained models from large-scale visual and audio datasets
                    have demonstrably generalized to this task, surprisingly, no studies have
                    explored pretrained speech models, which, as human-originated sounds,
                    intuitively would share closer resemblance to lung sounds. This paper explores
                    the efficacy of pretrained speech models for respiratory sound classification.
                    We find that there is a characterization gap between speech and lung sound
                    samples, and to bridge this gap, data augmentation is essential. However, the
                    most widely used augmentation technique for audio and speech, SpecAugment,
                    requires 2-dimensional spectrogram format and cannot be applied to models
                    pretrained on speech waveforms. To address this, we propose RepAugment, an
                    input-agnostic representation-level augmentation technique that outperforms
                    SpecAugment, but is also suitable for respiratory sound classification with
                    waveform pretrained models. Experimental results show that our approach
                    outperforms the SpecAugment, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the
                    accuracy of minority disease classes, reaching up to 7.14%.

                <p class="mathjax">Electric scooters (e-scooters) have rapidly emerged as a popular mode of
                    transportation in urban areas, yet they pose significant safety challenges. In
                    the United States, the rise of e-scooters has been marked by a concerning
                    increase in related injuries and fatalities. Recently, while deep-learning
                    object detection holds paramount significance in autonomous vehicles to avoid
                    potential collisions, its application in the context of e-scooters remains
                    relatively unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the
                    effectiveness and efficiency of cutting-edge object detectors designed for
                    e-scooters. To achieve this, the first comprehensive benchmark involving 22
                    state-of-the-art YOLO object detectors, including five versions (YOLOv3,
                    YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8), has been established for real-time traffic
                    object detection using a self-collected dataset featuring e-scooters. The
                    detection accuracy, measured in terms of mAP@0.5, ranges from 27.4%
                    (YOLOv7-E6E) to 86.8% (YOLOv5s). All YOLO models, particularly YOLOv3-tiny,
                    have displayed promising potential for real-time object detection in the
                    context of e-scooters. Both the traffic scene dataset
                    (https://zenodo.org/records/10578641) and software program codes
                    (https://github.com/DongChen06/ScooterDet) for model benchmarking in this study
                    are publicly available, which will not only improve e-scooter safety with
                    advanced object detection but also lay the groundwork for tailored solutions,
                    promising a safer and more sustainable urban micromobility landscape.

                <p class="mathjax">Routing and scheduling problems with time windows have long been important
                    optimization problems for logistics and planning. Many classical heuristics and
                    exact methods exist for such problems. However, there are no satisfactory
                    methods for generating routes using quantum computing (QC), for mainly two
                    reasons: inequality constraints, and the trade-off of feasibility and solution
                    quality. Inequality constraints are typically handled using slack variables;
                    and feasible solutions are found by filtering samples. These challenges are
                    amplified in the presence of noise inherent in QC. Here, we propose a greedy
                    algorithm that generates routes by using information from all samples obtained
                    from the quantum computer. By noticing the relationship between qubits in our
                    formulation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we designed an algorithm that
                    adaptively constructs a feasible solution.
                    <br>We prove its convergence to a feasible solution, and illustrate its efficacy
                    by solving the Fleet Sizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows
                    (FSVRPTW). Our computational results show that this method obtains a lower
                    objective value than the current state-of-the-art annealing approaches, both
                    classical and hybrid, for the same amount of time using D-Wave Hybrid Solvers.
                    We also show its robustness to noise on D-Wave Advantage 4.1 through
                    computational results as compared to the filtering approach on DWaveSampler,
                    even when the filtering approach is given a longer annealing time, and a larger
                    sample size.

                <p class="mathjax">The independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) method stands out as a
                    prominent technique for multichannel blind audio source separation. It
                    leverages nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and nonnegative canonical
                    polyadic decomposition (NCPD) to model source parameters. While it effectively
                    captures the low-rank structure of sources, the NMF model overlooks
                    inter-channel dependencies. On the other hand, NCPD preserves intrinsic
                    structure but lacks interpretable latent factors, making it challenging to
                    incorporate prior information as constraints. To address these limitations, we
                    introduce a clustered source model based on nonnegative block-term
                    decomposition (NBTD). This model defines blocks as outer products of vectors
                    (clusters) and matrices (for spectral structure modeling), offering
                    interpretable latent vectors. Moreover, it enables straightforward integration
                    of orthogonality constraints to ensure independence among source images.
                    Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms ILRMA and
                    its extensions in anechoic conditions and surpasses the original ILRMA in
                    simulated reverberant environments.

                <p class="mathjax">Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal AFDM access
                    (O-AFDMA) are promising techniques based on chirp signals, which are able to
                    suppress the performance deterioration caused by Doppler shifts in
                    high-mobility scenarios. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
                    in AFDM or O-AFDMA is still a crucial problem, which severely limits their
                    practical applications. In this paper, we propose a discrete affine Fourier
                    transform (DAFT)-spread AFDMA scheme based on the properties of the AFDM
                    systems, named DAFT-s-AFDMA to significantly reduce the PAPR by resorting to
                    the DAFT. We formulate the transmitted time-domain signals of the proposed
                    DAFT-s-AFDMA schemes with localized and interleaved chirp subcarrier allocation
                    strategies. Accordingly, we derive the guidelines for setting the DAFT
                    parameters, revealing the insights of PAPR reduction. Finally, simulation
                    results of PAPR comparison in terms of the complementary cumulative
                    distribution function (CCDF) show that the proposed DAFT-s-AFDMA schemes with
                    localized and interleaved strategies can both attain better PAPR performances
                    than the conventional O-AFDMA scheme.

                    a method to infer the conservativeness level of a decision-maker, represented
                    by the size of a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, from the optimal
                    decisions made using Forward Distributionally Robust Optimization (F-DRO). By
                    leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the convex F-DRO model,
                    we formulate I-DRO as a bi-linear program, which can be solved using
                    off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Additionally, this formulation exhibits
                    several advantageous properties. We demonstrate that I-DRO not only guarantees
                    the existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution but also establishes the
                    necessary and sufficient conditions for this optimal solution to accurately
                    match the actual conservativeness level in F-DRO. Furthermore, we identify
                    three extreme scenarios that may impact I-DRO effectiveness. Our case study
                    applies F-DRO for power system scheduling under uncertainty and employs I-DRO
                    to recover the conservativeness level of system operators. Numerical
                    experiments based on an IEEE 5-bus system and a realistic NYISO 11-zone system
                    demonstrate I-DRO performance in both normal and extreme scenarios.

                <p class="mathjax">In this paper we present the design and development of the Transhuman
                    Ansambl, a novel interactive singing-voice interface which senses its
                    environment and responds to vocal input with vocalisations using human voice.
                    Designed for live performance with a human performer and as a standalone sound
                    installation, the ansambl consists of sixteen bespoke virtual singers arranged
                    in a circle. When performing live, the virtual singers listen to the human
                    performer and respond to their singing by reading pitch, intonation and volume
                    cues. In a standalone sound installation mode, singers use ultrasonic distance
                    sensors to sense audience presence. Developed as part of the 1st author's
                    practice-based PhD and artistic practice as a live performer, this work employs
                    the singing-voice to explore voice interactions in HCI beyond language, and
                    innovative ways of live performing. How is technology supporting the effect of
                    intimacy produced through voice? Does the act of surrounding the audience with
                    responsive virtual singers challenge the traditional roles of
                    performer-listener? To answer these questions, we draw upon the 1st author's
                    experience with the system, and the interdisciplinary field of voice studies
                    that consider the voice as the sound medium independent of language, capable of
                    enacting a reciprocal connection between bodies.

                    continues to be a challenging task in the cross-modal domain. This paper
                    introduces PopDanceSet, the first dataset tailored to the preferences of young
                    audiences, enabling the generation of aesthetically oriented dances. And it
                    surpasses the AIST++ dataset in music genre diversity and the intricacy and
                    depth of dance movements. Moreover, the proposed POPDG model within the iDDPM
                    framework enhances dance diversity and, through the Space Augmentation
                    Algorithm, strengthens spatial physical connections between human body joints,
                    ensuring that increased diversity does not compromise generation quality. A
                    streamlined Alignment Module is also designed to improve the temporal alignment
                    between dance and music. Extensive experiments show that POPDG achieves SOTA
                    results on two datasets. Furthermore, the paper also expands on current
                    evaluation metrics. The dataset and code are available at

                <p class="mathjax">Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant
                    attention as a recently proposed RIS architecture. Owing to its capability to
                    amplify the incident signals, active RIS can mitigate the multiplicative fading
                    effect inherent in the passive RIS-aided system. In this paper, we consider an
                    active RIS-aided uplink multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output
                    (MIMO) system in the presence of phase noise at the active RIS. Specifically,
                    we employ a two-timescale scheme, where the beamforming at the base station
                    (BS) is adjusted based on the instantaneous aggregated channel state
                    information (CSI) and the statistical CSI serves as the basis for designing the
                    phase shifts at the active RIS, so that the feedback overhead and computational
                    complexity can be significantly reduced. The aggregated channel composed of the
                    cascaded and direct channels is estimated by utilizing the linear minimum mean
                    square error (LMMSE) technique. Based on the estimated channel, we derive the
                    analytical closed-form expression of a lower bound of the achievable rate. The
                    power scaling laws in the active RIS-aided system are investigated based on the
                    theoretical expressions. When the transmit power of each user is scaled down by
                    the number of BS antennas M or reflecting elements N, we find that the thermal
                    noise will cause the lower bound of the achievable rate to approach zero, as
                    the number of M or N increases to infinity. Moreover, an optimization approach
                    based on genetic algorithms (GA) is introduced to tackle the phase shift
                    optimization problem. Numerical results reveal that the active RIS can greatly
                    enhance the performance of the considered system under various settings.

                <p class="mathjax">Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet,
                    as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable
                    spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of
                    perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is,
                    therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may
                    comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental
                    signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally
                    correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of
                    multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of
                    sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of
                    the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the
                    denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement
                    worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting
                    GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are
                    transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals.
                    Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based
                    attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal
                    SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key
                    combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The
                    proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur
                    along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from
                    independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal
                    evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS
                    signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure.

                    in wind tunnel facilities. The total array consists of modular 800 microphone
                    panels, each consisting of four unique PCB board designs. This modular
                    architecture allows for the time-synchronized measurement of an arbitrary
                    number of panels and thus, aperture size and total number of sensors. The
                    panels can be installed without a gap so that the array's microphone pattern
                    avoids high sidelobes in the point spread function. The array's capabilities
                    are evaluated on a 1:9.5 airframe half model in an open wind tunnel at DNW-NWB.
                    The total source emission is quantified and the directivity is evaluated with
                    beamforming. Additional far-field microphones are employed to validate the
                    results.

                <p class="mathjax">With the impending arrival of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless
                    communication technology, the telecommunications landscape is poised for
                    another revolutionary transformation. At the forefront of this evolution are
                    intelligent meta-surfaces (IS), emerging as a disruptive physical layer
                    technology with the potential to redefine the capabilities and performance
                    metrics of future wireless networks. As 6G evolves from concept to reality,
                    industry stakeholders, standards organizations, and regulatory bodies are
                    collaborating to define the specifications, protocols, and interoperability
                    standards governing IS deployment. Against this background, this article delves
                    into the ongoing standardization efforts, emerging trends, potential
                    opportunities, and prevailing challenges surrounding the integration of IS into
                    the framework of 6G and beyond networks. Specifically, it provides a
                    tutorial-style overview of recent advancements in IS and explores their

                <p class="mathjax">We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method
                    (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for
                    cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a
                    discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array
                    of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters.
                    These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the
                    6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption
                    coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a
                    recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with
                    new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection
                    identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery
                    of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical
                    microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input
                    parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors
                    decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method
                    is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to
                    extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is
                    strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla
                    shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic
                    demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully
                    solvable over a wide range of configurations.

                <p class="mathjax">The calibration of MEMS triaxial gyroscopes is crucial for achieving precise
                    attitude estimation for various wearable health monitoring applications.
                    However, gyroscope calibration poses greater challenges compared to
                    accelerometers and magnetometers. This paper introduces an efficient method for
                    calibrating MEMS triaxial gyroscopes via only a servo motor, making it
                    well-suited for field environments. The core strategy of the method involves
                    utilizing the fact that the dot product of the measured gravity and the
                    rotational speed in a fixed frame remains constant. To eliminate the influence
                    of rotating centrifugal force on the accelerometer, the accelerometer data is
                    measured while stationary. The proposed calibration experiment scheme, which
                    allows gyroscopic measurements when operating each axis at a specific rotation
                    speed, making it easier to evaluate the linearity across a related speed range
                    constituted by a series of rotation speeds. Moreover, solely the classical
                    least squares algorithm proves adequate for estimating the scale factor,
                    notably streamlining the analysis of the calibration process. Extensive
                    numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the proposed method's
                    performance in calibrating a triaxial gyroscope model. Experimental validation
                    was also carried out using a commercially available MEMS inertial measurement
                    unit (LSM9DS1 from Arduino nano 33 BLE SENSE) and a servo motor capable of
                    controlling precise speed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the
                    efficacy of the proposed calibration approach.

                <p class="mathjax">In complex traffic environments, autonomous vehicles face multi-modal
                    uncertainty about other agents' future behavior. To address this, recent
                    advancements in learningbased motion predictors output multi-modal predictions.
                    We present our novel framework that leverages Branch Model Predictive
                    Control(BMPC) to account for these predictions. The framework includes an
                    online scenario-selection process guided by topology and collision risk
                    criteria. This efficiently selects a minimal set of predictions, rendering the
                    BMPC realtime capable. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive decision
                    postponing strategy that delays the planner's commitment to a single scenario
                    until the uncertainty is resolved. Our comprehensive evaluations in traffic
                    intersection and random highway merging scenarios demonstrate enhanced comfort

                <p class="mathjax">Large general-purpose transformer models have recently become the mainstay in
                    the realm of speech analysis. In particular, Whisper achieves state-of-the-art
                    results in relevant tasks such as speech recognition, translation, language
                    identification, and voice activity detection. However, Whisper models are not
                    designed to be used in real-time conditions, and this limitation makes them
                    unsuitable for a vast plethora of practical applications. In this paper, we
                    introduce Whispy, a system intended to bring live capabilities to the Whisper
                    pretrained models. As a result of a number of architectural optimisations,
                    Whispy is able to consume live audio streams and generate high level, coherent
                    voice transcriptions, while still maintaining a low computational cost. We
                    evaluate the performance of our system on a large repository of publicly
                    available speech datasets, investigating how the transcription mechanism
                    introduced by Whispy impacts on the Whisper output. Experimental results show
                    how Whispy excels in robustness, promptness, and accuracy.

                <p class="mathjax">A two-wheeled self-balancing robot (TWSBR) is non-linear and unstable system.
                    This study compares the performance of model-based and data-based control
                    strategies for TWSBRs, with an explicit practical educational approach.
                    Model-based control (MBC) algorithms such as Lead-Lag and PID control require a
                    proficient dynamic modeling and mathematical manipulation to drive the
                    linearized equations of motions and develop the appropriate controller. On the
                    other side, data-based control (DBC) methods, like fuzzy control, provide a
                    simpler and quicker approach to designing effective controllers without needing
                    in-depth understanding of the system model. In this paper, the advantages and
                    disadvantages of both MBC and DBC using a TWSBR are illustrated. All
                    controllers were implemented and tested on the OSOYOO self-balancing kit,
                    including an Arduino microcontroller, MPU-6050 sensor, and DC motors. The
                    control law and the user interface are constructed using the LabVIEW-LINX
                    toolkit. A real-time hardware-in-loop experiment validates the results,
                    highlighting controllers that can be implemented on a cost-effective platform.

                <p class="mathjax">Acoustic scene classification (ASC) is highly important in the real world.
                    Recently, deep learning-based methods have been widely employed for acoustic
                    scene classification. However, these methods are currently not lightweight
                    enough as well as their performance is not satisfactory. To solve these
                    problems, we propose a deep space separable distillation network. Firstly, the
                    network performs high-low frequency decomposition on the log-mel spectrogram,
                    significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining model
                    performance. Secondly, we specially design three lightweight operators for ASC,
                    including Separable Convolution (SC), Orthonormal Separable Convolution (OSC),
                    and Separable Partial Convolution (SPC). These operators exhibit highly
                    efficient feature extraction capabilities in acoustic scene classification
                    tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a
                    performance gain of 9.8% compared to the currently popular deep learning
                    methods, while also having smaller parameter count and computational
                    complexity.
